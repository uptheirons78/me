          It all started in the late 2008 when a good friend of mine asked me if
          I knew someone to help him to build a website. His budget was so low
          he couldn't find a good developer to help him and being the good guy I
          am{" "}

          I decided to do it for free. So I discovered something called
          Wordpress and really felt in love with this world.

          On my spare time I started learning HTML and the basic of CSS. Then I
          began to play just a little with PHP, Custom Post Types, Advanced
          Custom Fields and some JQuery to create my own themes or to change and
          modify others. I never thought I could change my career and built many
          websites for my friends and for fun until I realized I like coding and
          what a dream it can be to do it on a daily basis.

          So during 2017 I started learning Vanilla Javascript and on September
          of the same here I've got my Front-End Certification on FreeCodeCamp.
          Then I added Node, Express, MongoDB and React to my skills so I could
          provide Full-Stack Javescript services to clients.

          The tools I use daily are HTML, CSS (Sass/PostCss), Wordpress,
          JavaScript, React and Git. I have experience also with PHP, Node.js,
          Express, MongoDB and MySQL. Working hard day after day I really want
          to strengthen my programming fundamentals, improve my JavaScript and
          build more personal projects to grab more familiarity both on the
          Front-End and the Back-End. Currently, I am really in love with the
          JAM-Stack ecosystem and working a lot with GatsbyJS, Markdown,
          GraphQL, and serverless functions. Actually this website is built with
          Gatsby, Markdown and many fantastic tools like React-Slick and
          React-Spring.

          When I am not in front of a computer, I am probably running, listening
          to some good Rock or Heavy Metal music, reading a book, hanging out
          with my wife Valentina and my beautiful daughter Chloe{" "}
